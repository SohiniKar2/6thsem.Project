 Skin Disease Detection Using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify skin disease images into different categories.

ðŸš€ Overview
Preprocesses image data using ImageDataGenerator

Trains a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and batch normalization layers

Evaluates model using accuracy and confusion matrix

Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, PIL

 Results
CNN achieved good accuracy on validation data

Visualized performance with loss/accuracy curves and confusion matrix
